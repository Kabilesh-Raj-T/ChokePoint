# BlastRadius

BlastRadius is a Python CLI tool that builds infrastructure dependency graphs
and detects single points of failure using graph algorithms.

It models services, databases, DNS providers, identity systems, cloud services,
and external dependencies as a graph. BlastRadius then uses NetworkX analysis to
find articulation points, bridge edges, blast radius, and dependency paths.

The Python package and CLI command remain `chokepoint` for 1.0.0 compatibility.

## How To Use BlastRadius

BlastRadius works best as a local architecture-review tool. Give it a topology
file or a repository, then review the generated dependency-risk report with the
people who own the services.

### 1. Install the project

Use `uv` from the repository root:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then run commands through `uv`:

```bash
uv run chokepoint --help
```

The project is branded as BlastRadius, but the Python package and CLI command
remain `chokepoint` for the 1.0.0 release.

### 2. Create a topology file

Start with a small `topology.yaml` that lists infrastructure dependencies:

```yaml
clouds:
  - aws
  - azure

dns:
  - cloudflare

identity:
  - okta

services:
  frontend:
    depends_on:
      - cloudflare
      - okta

  api:
    depends_on:
      - aws
      - okta

database:
  depends_on:
    - aws
```

This means `frontend` depends on Cloudflare and Okta, `api` depends on AWS and
Okta, and `database` depends on AWS.

### 3. Validate the input

```bash
uv run chokepoint validate topology.yaml
```

Expected result:

```text
Valid topology: 7 node(s), 5 edge(s)
```

If the file is malformed, BlastRadius prints a clear error with the file and
location whenever possible.

### 4. Analyze dependency risk

```bash
uv run chokepoint analyze topology.yaml
```

Use Markdown when you want a GitHub-friendly report:

```bash
uv run chokepoint analyze topology.yaml --markdown
```

Use JSON when another tool needs to consume the result:

```bash
uv run chokepoint analyze topology.yaml --json
```

The report can include:

- shared dependencies such as DNS, identity, cloud, database, and CI/CD nodes
- hidden single points of failure
- articulation points that disconnect parts of the graph
- bridge edges with no alternate path
- affected nodes and dependency chains
- confidence labels explaining how strongly the tool trusts a finding
- recommendations for resilience review

### 5. View or export the graph

Get graph metrics:

```bash
uv run chokepoint graph topology.yaml
uv run chokepoint graph topology.yaml --json
```

Export graph/report artifacts:

```bash
uv run chokepoint export topology.yaml --format mermaid
uv run chokepoint export topology.yaml --format svg > dependency-graph.svg
uv run chokepoint export topology.yaml --format csv > dependencies.csv
```

### 6. Scan an existing repository

BlastRadius can scan a repository for supported files such as topology YAML,
Terraform, and Docker Compose:

```bash
uv run chokepoint scan /path/to/repo --markdown
```

Repository scanning is best-effort. For real systems, add a YAML topology file
or overlay for external dependencies that are not visible in code, such as DNS
providers, identity providers, payment providers, CI/CD, monitoring, and
secrets managers.

### 7. Interpret the results

Treat the output as an architecture-review aid, not as absolute production
truth. A good workflow is:

```text
Run BlastRadius
Add missing external dependencies
Review findings with service owners
Prioritize high-blast-radius dependencies
Track resilience improvements
```

For example, a report might show that Okta is shared by several services, or
that a frontend service is an articulation point. That does not automatically
mean the system is broken; it means the dependency deserves review.

## Core Features

- Parses YAML infrastructure dependency files.
- Parses basic Terraform HCL resources.
- Parses basic Docker Compose services and `depends_on` relationships.
- Scans repositories to auto-discover supported topology, Terraform, and Docker
  Compose files.
- Builds a typed topology model with Pydantic.
- Converts infrastructure dependencies into a NetworkX graph.
- Detects articulation points, bridge edges, connected components, cycles, and
  centrality.
- Generates terminal, Markdown, JSON, CSV, Mermaid, and SVG output.
- Labels findings with high, medium, or low confidence so inferred claims can be
  reviewed before action.
- Provides a Click/Rich CLI for local analysis.

## What This Project Demonstrates

BlastRadius is designed as a portfolio-friendly infrastructure graph analyzer. It
demonstrates:

- Python 3.12+ project structure
- typed domain models
- CLI design
- graph algorithms
- parser design
- test coverage and CI
- documentation and project hygiene

## Engineering Baseline

The repository uses modern Python engineering practices:

- `uv` for package and environment management
- `pyproject.toml` as the single project configuration surface
- `src/` package layout
- `pytest` for testing
- `ruff`, `black`, and `mypy` for quality gates
- `pre-commit` hooks
- GitHub Actions CI

## Development

Install the development environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

Run the checks used by CI:

```bash
uv sync
uv run black --check src tests scripts
uv run ruff check src tests scripts
uv run mypy
uv run pytest -q
```

Use `uv run ...` for commands that must work from a completely clean shell. The
project uses a `src/` layout and relies on uv to create the Python 3.12+
environment and install test dependencies before collection.

If you prefer plain commands such as `pytest -q` or `chokepoint analyze ...`,
activate the uv virtual environment first:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pytest -q
chokepoint analyze examples/topology-basic.yaml
```

Install local hooks:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

## CLI

Common commands:

```bash
uv run chokepoint analyze examples/basic.yaml
uv run chokepoint graph examples/basic.yaml --json
uv run chokepoint report examples/basic.yaml --markdown
uv run chokepoint validate examples/basic.yaml
uv run chokepoint export examples/basic.yaml --format mermaid
uv run chokepoint export examples/basic.yaml --format svg
uv run chokepoint diff examples/topology-basic.yaml examples/topology-expanded.yaml --json
uv run chokepoint scan /path/to/repo --markdown
```

`analyze` and `report` explain the topology in terms of a visual dependency
graph, hidden single points of failure, blast radius, and why each risky
dependency matters.

Use `--verbose` before the command for colored diagnostic logs:

```bash
uv run chokepoint --verbose validate examples/topology-basic.yaml
```
