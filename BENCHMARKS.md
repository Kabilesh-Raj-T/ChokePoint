# Performance Notes

Check date: 2026-07-19

Environment:

- OS: Windows
- Python: 3.12.13
- Package manager: uv
- Mode: local smoke performance checks

These numbers are included to show basic performance awareness. They are not a
claim that every parser or report path has been tuned for large real-world
systems.

## Algorithmic Complexity

| Operation | Expected Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| Topology validation | `O(V + E)` |
| Graph construction | `O(V + E)` |
| Connected components | `O(V + E)` |
| Articulation points | `O(V + E)` |
| Bridges | `O(V + E)` |
| Degree centrality | `O(V + E)` |
| Betweenness centrality | `O(V * E)` |
| Cycle detection | `O(V + E)` |

## Smoke Results

Synthetic topology shape:

- One shared DNS node.
- `N` service nodes.
- One service-to-DNS dependency per service.
- One additional service-to-service dependency after the first 10 services.

| Size | Build Graph | Full Graph Analysis | Risk Analysis | Report |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 100 services | 2.53 ms | 26.02 ms | 11.26 ms | 38.34 ms |
| 500 services | 32.83 ms | 918.47 ms | 227.27 ms | 881.94 ms |
| 1,000 services | 31.21 ms | 3,020.29 ms | 741.71 ms | 3,965.94 ms |

## Notes

The graph engine delegates centrality and structural analysis to NetworkX.
Exact betweenness centrality is the dominant cost in full graph analysis.
Risk analysis avoids exact centrality and uses validation plus articulation
point detection for its low-risk rule.
