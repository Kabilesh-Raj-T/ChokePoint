# Release Candidate Report

Release candidate: `1.0.0`
Review date: 2026-07-20

## Readiness Score

Score: 98/100

BlastRadius is ready for a public release candidate. The package installs from a
clean environment, the CLI entry points are configured, strict quality gates are
active, coverage is above the release threshold, and CI covers the supported
Python and operating system matrix.

## Issues Reviewed

| Severity | Area | Finding | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | Packaging | No broken package discovery, missing entry point, or import-blocking issue found. | No action needed |
| Critical | Testing | Full test collection and execution passed locally with coverage above 95%. | No action needed |
| Critical | Security | No unsafe YAML loading, shell execution, dynamic evaluation, or pickle usage found in production code. | No action needed |
| High | CI/CD | CI validates Ubuntu, Windows, macOS, Python 3.12, Python 3.13, pre-commit, type checks, tests, builds, and smoke installs. | No action needed |
| High | CLI | Installed CLI and module entry point are covered by smoke-install validation. | No action needed |
| Medium | Packaging | Package classifier still advertised the project as Beta while versioned as 1.0.0. | Fixed |
| Medium | Tooling | Ruff source configuration did not include `scripts`, even though CI linted scripts explicitly. | Fixed |
| Medium | Documentation | Release notes, README, technical debt report, and pull request checklist had stale verification commands. | Fixed |
| Medium | Security Docs | Security policy mentioned Graphviz even though the main branch uses local graph/report output without Graphviz invocation. | Fixed |
| Medium | Reports | Markdown report dependency graphs omitted isolated topology nodes. | Fixed |
| Medium | Documentation | README screenshot, architecture diagram, changelog, project tree, and security issue link needed release alignment. | Fixed |
| Low | Release Automation | The release workflow builds and uploads artifacts, but does not publish to PyPI automatically. | Accepted |
| Low | Plugin Architecture | The main branch stays focused on the core analyzer and does not expose a broad plugin API. | Accepted |
| Low | Performance | Exact centrality on very large graphs can be expensive, which is inherent to the selected NetworkX algorithms. | Accepted |

## Audit Summary

- Architecture: Layered `src/` layout separates CLI, parsers, graph engine,
  models, reports, visualization/export, and utilities.
- Packaging: `pyproject.toml` uses Hatchling, package discovery points to
  `src/blastradius`, and the project includes a `py.typed` marker.
- Public API: The module imports cleanly and exposes the package version.
- Public report API: Structured reports expose dependency graph nodes and edges
  so Markdown, JSON, and terminal outputs can represent complete topologies.
- CLI: `blastradius` is configured as a console script and `python -m
  blastradius` delegates to the CLI.
- Testing: Unit and integration tests cover imports, parsers, graph analysis,
  risk reports, exports, examples, repository scanning, CLI behavior, and
  complete report graph rendering.
- Dependency management: Runtime dependencies are bounded, and development
  dependencies are pinned through the uv lockfile.
- Security: Production parsing uses safe libraries and avoids shell execution.
- Logging and errors: CLI paths convert parsing and validation failures into
  user-facing errors instead of tracebacks.
- CI/CD: CI runs the supported OS and Python matrix, verifies formatting,
  linting, typing, tests, coverage, package builds, and install smoke tests.

## Remaining Risks

- Publishing is intentionally manual: maintainers must attach or publish the
  built distributions after the release workflow finishes.
- BlastRadius's inferred dependency findings should still be reviewed by service
  owners before being treated as operational truth.
- Future parser expansion should include targeted fixtures before broadening the
  documented support surface.
