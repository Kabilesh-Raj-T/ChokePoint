# Docker Compose Parser

BlastRadius can parse basic Docker Compose YAML into a topology.

## API

```python
from blastradius.parser import DockerComposeParser

topology = DockerComposeParser().parse_file("docker-compose.yml")
```

Available entry points:

- `parse_docker_compose_text(payload, source="<string>")`
- `parse_docker_compose_file(path)`
- `DockerComposeParser().parse_file(path)`

## What It Extracts

- Compose services as service nodes.
- `depends_on` relationships between services.
- Compose variable defaults in `depends_on`, such as
  `${APP_DB_HOST:-postgresql}`.
- Referenced networks as network nodes.
- Referenced volumes as storage nodes.
- Referenced secrets as secret nodes.

This parser is intentionally small. It is useful for demos and simple local
Compose files, but it does not try to fully emulate Docker Compose resolution.
Local bind mounts such as `./src:/app/src` are ignored because they usually
represent source-code paths, not shared infrastructure dependencies.
