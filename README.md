# ChokePoint

ChokePoint is a Python CLI tool that builds infrastructure dependency graphs
and detects single points of failure using graph algorithms.

It models services, databases, DNS providers, identity systems, cloud services,
and external dependencies as a graph. ChokePoint then uses NetworkX analysis to
find articulation points, bridge edges, blast radius, and dependency paths.

## Quick Demo

Run the analyzer against one of the included examples:

```bash
uv run chokepoint analyze examples/topology-microservices.yaml --markdown
```

The report shows:

- a Mermaid dependency graph
- hidden single points of failure
- articulation points and bridge edges
- blast radius and dependency chains

## Core Features

- Parses YAML infrastructure dependency files.
- Parses basic Terraform HCL resources.
- Parses basic Docker Compose services and `depends_on` relationships.
- Builds a typed topology model with Pydantic.
- Converts infrastructure dependencies into a NetworkX graph.
- Detects articulation points, bridge edges, connected components, cycles, and
  centrality.
- Generates terminal, Markdown, JSON, CSV, and Mermaid output.
- Provides a Click/Rich CLI for local analysis.

## What This Project Demonstrates

ChokePoint is designed as a portfolio-friendly infrastructure graph analyzer. It
demonstrates:

- Python 3.12+ project structure
- typed domain models
- CLI design
- graph algorithms
- parser design
- test coverage and CI
- documentation and project hygiene

## Engineering Baseline

The repository uses modern Python engineering practices:

- `uv` for package and environment management
- `pyproject.toml` as the single project configuration surface
- `src/` package layout
- `pytest` for testing
- `ruff`, `black`, and `mypy` for quality gates
- `pre-commit` hooks
- GitHub Actions CI

## Development

Install the development environment:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

Run the checks used by CI:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run black --check src tests
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
```

Use `uv run pytest`, not a global `pytest` command. The project uses a
`src/` layout and relies on uv to create the Python 3.12+ environment and
install test dependencies before collection.

Install local hooks:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

## CLI

Common commands:

```bash
uv run chokepoint analyze examples/topology-microservices.yaml
uv run chokepoint graph examples/topology-microservices.yaml --json
uv run chokepoint report examples/topology-microservices.yaml --markdown
uv run chokepoint validate examples/topology-microservices.yaml
uv run chokepoint export examples/topology-microservices.yaml --format mermaid
uv run chokepoint diff examples/topology-basic.yaml examples/topology-expanded.yaml --json
```

`analyze` and `report` explain the topology in terms of a visual dependency
graph, hidden single points of failure, blast radius, and why each risky
dependency matters.

Use `--verbose` before the command for colored diagnostic logs:

```bash
uv run chokepoint --verbose validate examples/topology-basic.yaml
```
